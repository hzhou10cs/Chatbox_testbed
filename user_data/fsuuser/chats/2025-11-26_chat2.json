      "assistant": "It's great to hear you're walking 2 hours today. Do you have any food or drinks in mind that would help you achieve your daily goal? It's always helpful to have some snacks or drinks that are easy to prepare and won't weigh you down. Remember, every little bit helps when it comes to weight loss.\n\nBest of luck to you on your weight-loss journey, and happy walking!"
